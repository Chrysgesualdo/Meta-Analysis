# Project Title: Meta Analysis – Expectancy Challenge Alcohol Intervention

## Techniques Used:
- Systematic literature search
- Effect size calculation (Hedge’s g)
- Random-effects model
- Exploratory data analysis
- Descriptive statistics
- Moderator analysis (inverse variance weighted regressions, one-way ANOVAs)
- Trim-and-fill analysis for publication bias
- Homogeneity testing
- Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software

## Summary:
This project involved a meta-analysis of 23 studies to evaluate the effectiveness of Expectancy Challenge (EC) interventions in reducing alcohol use and changing alcohol expectancies among high school and college students. I conducted a systematic literature search, coded and included studies that reported relevant and sufficient data for effect size calculation. Using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software and SPSS, I calculated effect sizes and performed moderator analysis.
