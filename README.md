- **Random-Effects Model:** Accounting for variability among study results.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Investigating initial patterns and insights.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing data characteristics.
- **Moderator Analysis:** Using inverse variance weighted regressions and one-way ANOVAs.
- **Trim-and-Fill Analysis for Publication Bias:** Assessing the impact of unpublished studies.

## Summary
This project involved a meta-analysis of 23 studies to evaluate the effectiveness of Expectancy Challenge (EC) interventions in reducing alcohol use and changing alcohol expectancies among high school and college students. I conducted a systematic literature search, coded and included studies that reported relevant and sufficient data for effect size calculation. Using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software and SPSS, I calculated effect sizes and performed moderator analysis.
